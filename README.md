### ðŸš€ Getting Started

The `btp-cockpit-ans-configuration` folder is **not required** within the CAP project itself. It is included **only for reference**, containing details of the ANS (Alert Notification Service) instance and its key.

> ðŸ”” **Important:**
> There is **no need to bind** the ANS service to the CAP application in order to capture events.
> It is sufficient for the ANS instance to be present **at the space level** where the CAP application is deployed.
